Welsh translations for PWM software. We translated these for work back in 2018, I did offer them to the PWM project but no one ever got back to me to initiate contact.

I am releasing them here to help anyone in Wales who needs them for their own install to comply with current legislation.

You need to add the CY locale to your server, this is out of scope of this information release.
sorry its a raw part of the PWMConfiguration.xml file, i dont know of any other way to do this.

  enjoyo!
